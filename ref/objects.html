3.1 Objects, values and types
</h1>

<p>
<i class="dfn">Objects</i> are Python's abstraction for data.  All data in a Python
program is represented by objects or by relations between objects.
(In a sense, and in conformance to Von Neumann's model of a
``stored program computer,'' code is also represented by objects.)
<a id='l2h-28' xml:id='l2h-28'></a>

<p>
Every object has an identity, a type and a value.  An object's
<em>identity</em> never changes once it has been created; you may think
of it as the object's address in memory.  The `<tt class="keyword">is</tt>' operator
compares the identity of two objects; the
<tt class="function">id()</tt><a id='l2h-26' xml:id='l2h-26'></a> function returns an integer
representing its identity (currently implemented as its address).
An object's <i class="dfn">type</i> is
also unchangeable.<a name="tex2html2"
  href="#foot2446"><sup>3.1</sup></a>
An object's type determines the operations that the object
supports (e.g., ``does it have a length?'') and also defines the
possible values for objects of that type.  The
<tt class="function">type()</tt><a id='l2h-27' xml:id='l2h-27'></a> function returns an object's type
(which is an object itself).  The <em>value</em> of some
objects can change.  Objects whose value can change are said to be
<em>mutable</em>; objects whose value is unchangeable once they are
created are called <em>immutable</em>.
(The value of an immutable container object that contains a reference
to a mutable object can change when the latter's value is changed;
however the container is still considered immutable, because the
collection of objects it contains cannot be changed.  So, immutability
is not strictly the same as having an unchangeable value, it is more
subtle.)
An object's mutability is determined by its type; for instance,
numbers, strings and tuples are immutable, while dictionaries and
lists are mutable.
<a id='l2h-29' xml:id='l2h-29'></a>

<p>
Objects are never explicitly destroyed; however, when they become
unreachable they may be garbage-collected.  An implementation is
allowed to postpone garbage collection or omit it altogether -- it is
a matter of implementation quality how garbage collection is
implemented, as long as no objects are collected that are still
reachable.  (Implementation note: the current implementation uses a
reference-counting scheme with (optional) delayed detection of
cyclically linked garbage, which collects most objects as soon as they
become unreachable, but is not guaranteed to collect garbage
containing circular references.  See the
<em class="citetitle"><a
 href="../lib/module-gc.html"
 title="Python Library Reference"
 >Python Library Reference</a></em> for
information on controlling the collection of cyclic garbage.)
<a id='l2h-30' xml:id='l2h-30'></a>

<p>
Note that the use of the implementation's tracing or debugging
facilities may keep objects alive that would normally be collectable.
Also note that catching an exception with a
`<tt class="keyword">try</tt>...<tt class="keyword">except</tt>' statement may keep objects alive.

<p>
Some objects contain references to ``external'' resources such as open
files or windows.  It is understood that these resources are freed
when the object is garbage-collected, but since garbage collection is
not guaranteed to happen, such objects also provide an explicit way to
release the external resource, usually a <tt class="method">close()</tt> method.
Programs are strongly recommended to explicitly close such
objects.  The `<tt class="keyword">try</tt>...<tt class="keyword">finally</tt>' statement provides
a convenient way to do this.

<p>
Some objects contain references to other objects; these are called
<em>containers</em>.  Examples of containers are tuples, lists and
dictionaries.  The references are part of a container's value.  In
most cases, when we talk about the value of a container, we imply the
values, not the identities of the contained objects; however, when we
talk about the mutability of a container, only the identities of
the immediately contained objects are implied.  So, if an immutable
container (like a tuple)
contains a reference to a mutable object, its value changes
if that mutable object is changed.
<a id='l2h-31' xml:id='l2h-31'></a>

<p>
Types affect almost all aspects of object behavior.  Even the importance
of object identity is affected in some sense: for immutable types,
operations that compute new values may actually return a reference to
any existing object with the same type and value, while for mutable
objects this is not allowed.  E.g., after
"<tt class="samp">a = 1; b = 1</tt>",
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> may or may not refer to the same object with the
value one, depending on the implementation, but after
"<tt class="samp">c = []; d = []</tt>", <code>c</code> and <code>d</code>
are guaranteed to refer to two different, unique, newly created empty
lists.
(Note that "<tt class="samp">c = d = []</tt>" assigns the same object to both
<code>c</code> and <code>d</code>.)

<dd>Since Python 2.2, a gradual merging of
types and classes has been started that makes this and a few other
assertions made in this manual not 100% accurate and complete:
for example, it <em>is</em> now possible in some cases to change an
object's type, under certain controlled conditions.  Until this manual
undergoes extensive revision, it must now be taken as authoritative
only regarding ``classic classes'', that are still the default, for
compatibility purposes, in Python 2.2 and 2.3.  For more information,
